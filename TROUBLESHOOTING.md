# PlantBot Serverless Function Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. Common Causes of "Oops! Something went wrong" Errors
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set.
- **Invalid API Key**: Check if the OpenAI API key is correct and active.
- **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity and CORS settings.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure requests are within allowed limits.
- **Function Timeout**: Check if the function execution time exceeds limits.

## 2. How to Check Vercel Deployment Logs
- Navigate to your Vercel dashboard.
- Select the project and go to the "Deployments" tab.
- Click on the latest deployment to view logs.
- Look for error messages or warnings related to the function.

## 3. Environment Variable Setup Verification
- Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the Vercel environment.
- Verify other necessary environment variables are correctly configured.
- Use `console.log(process.env)` in the function to debug environment variables.

## 4. API Key Validation Steps
- Check the OpenAI API key in the Vercel environment settings.
- Validate the key by making a test request to OpenAI API.
- Ensure the key has the necessary permissions and is not expired.

## 5. Network and CORS Debugging
- Verify CORS headers are correctly set in the function.
- Use tools like `curl` or Postman to test API endpoints.
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings.

## 6. Function Timeout and Performance Issues
- Optimize code to reduce execution time.
- Increase timeout settings in Vercel if possible.
- Use logging to identify slow operations.

## 7. Rate Limiting Troubleshooting
- Check rate limiting logic in the function.
- Ensure the rate limit window and request count are correctly configured.
- Monitor logs for rate limit errors.

## 8. Step-by-Step Debugging Process
- Add detailed logging at each step of the function.
- Use try-catch blocks to capture and log errors.
- Test each part of the function separately to isolate issues.

## 9. Common Error Messages and Solutions
- **"Internal Server Error"**: Check logs for stack traces and debug accordingly.
- **"Too Many Requests"**: Verify rate limiting logic and adjust limits.
- **"Bad Request"**: Ensure input validation is correctly implemented.

## 10. Testing Methods to Verify the Function Works
- Use unit tests to validate function logic.
- Perform integration tests with mock data.
- Use Vercel's preview deployments to test changes before production.
